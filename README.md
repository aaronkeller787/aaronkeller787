# 👋 Hi, I'm Aaron Keller

I'm a **Cloud Engineer and Infrastructure Automation Specialist** with over 8 years of experience in system administration, scripting, and cloud operations. I focus on building reliable, scalable solutions using **PowerShell, Python**, and **API-driven automation** to eliminate manual tasks and increase operational efficiency.

I’ve worked extensively with platforms like **VMware Cloud Director**, **Veeam**, and **Zerto**, creating tools that save hours of engineering time and standardize critical processes. I’m also experienced with **Linux systems**, **networking**, and performing database migrations and benchmarking with **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, and **PostgreSQL**.

Currently, I'm pivoting toward a more **database engineering and development**-focused role, continuing to leverage automation to support reliability and performance at scale.
